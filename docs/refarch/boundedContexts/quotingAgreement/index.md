   - Amount Requested (initial amount)
     - Value (number)

    - Amount to send (including fees, etc.)
      - Value (number)
      - Currency (ISO currency code)
 - Payee(s) (one or more - should all be added to the "Amount to send")
   - '#'
     - Participant
       - participantId
       - roleType <-- Identify why this "payee" is receiving this amount, i.e.: fee, recipient, etc.
       - reason
       - Amount to receive
         - value (number)

 - Extensions

## Concluding comments

 * No red flag issues have been observed in the overall BC and Reference Architecture design.
 * We need to better understand/calrify the "GET" via "POST" pattern:
   * Should a "GET" event be a simple Restful "GET", or does the system need to support the "GET" from duplicate posts?
   * Are we required to serve "GET" requests that include FSP details at a later date?
